I forked this project in order to be able to read data from the public data [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tEt4c_brbIT2TtRqiGPmVYWvcfRPNQaU2D7gzUJLTaU/edit#gid=0).
The guide published [here](https://isoblue.org/docs/data/read) is outdated and the links do not work.
I built some docker and bash scripts to extract the data, which is stored in an atypical format (kafka .log files).
